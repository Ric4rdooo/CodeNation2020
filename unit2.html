            <p>2.1 - Trello is very useful to use and keep you very organised in completeing task and especially when working in groups you can give everyone a role on what to work on targets and deadlines and the kanbam method "doing" "do" "done" make it
                very simple to get to grips with. if i had more time i would of added more ideas to the "doing" section. i can not really recall any negatives points about trello. zoom made speaking to the teachers and students very easy and the share
                screen feature made problem solving a blast with helping when issues arise or others. i can see how this can be used in a multitude of enviroments both educational and working

            </p><br>
            <p>2.2 - vs code visual studio code was very appropriate how appropriate was vs code and trello for me and how that can be appropriate and easy it can be picked up ect coloured coded ect cambam method but easy for everyone to pick up if they
                have to. it did exactly what we needed it to do


            </p><br>

            <p>2.3 - Strengths: I can now design and write content for a website from scratch. I understand the function of each line of code and can use this to include functioning aspects of the site, including buttons and links to other pages. I can see
                how this could be a valuable tool in the future. Weaknesses: I felt restricted on time. If there was no time restrictions I would have perfected it in a way I would be comfortable with, to how I invisioned it to be.


            </p><br>

            <p>2.4 - the furture improvments i would make to the website would be adding more functions in javascript html and css for more of an animated feel to the website overall but with the time frame i had i kind off felt limited and played it safe
                amd simple
            </p><br>

            <p>2.5 â€“ i was not given a list but i was given tools to allow me to set list and methodial order of doing / completeing the task given in a cambam mnethod i have created a fully functional website from scratch. With my website project we also
                needed to have a functional navigation bar and custom imagery and all the data displayed in a nice and neat way using modern design techniques. i wanted to add more functions in javascript but i did not have the time to do so
