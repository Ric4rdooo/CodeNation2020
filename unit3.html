            <p>3.1 - i have been more efficent on website while i was working in team on our game the way we planned it and how we came together and sorted our ideas and issues out Whilst working in a team you played at each others strengths and helped each
                other providing moral support and reassurance. Each member had a task which benefitted from their area of expertise. i felt less pressure as i was equally responsible for the work produced. Working individually for the website project
                meant i got frustrated easier when i didnâ€™t know how to do something and felt more pressure to do the work to a higher standard as the responsibility was only on me.

            </p><br>

            <p>3.2 - it was my first time working in online teaching enviroment and i and i think i would of been more productive if i was in a working out of home enviroment. i found that when working from home as it was my first time there was more distraction
                and much harder to come out and ask fro help as there was another 25people in the lesson who i felt like i would slow down and its also more difficuilt to show the problems to instructors. i felt like i could of picked things up much faster
                in a face to face enviroment as the qurantine has got us all down but never the less having people with knowledge and insite being able to converese back and foruth to get challenges and orperations finish alot faster and people being
                able to see things before me

            </p><br>

            <p>3.3 - the way i would of improved the productivity and effciency is actually give myself more time to plan in a methodical approach to the task given. when working in a team i felt more productiveas issues that arose would be solved and defused
                much faster and there was more eyes to iron out the kinks. what would i do differently and time having more time to do things i can invision something i would weant to add and utalise everyone int eam knowledge and some people have front
                end deveopment and other stronger in back end having team moral how slack is usfull to communicate as with the pandemic we are not in work enivroment

            </p><br>

            <p>3.4 - Test my website myself to check the functions and readability. Share my screen to explain what i expect my website to do. Ask for other peoples feedback on how to improve the website or fix issues i might have.
