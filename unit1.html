        <h2>Unit 1 Outcome 1</h2>

        <p>1.1 - Companies rely on IT for fast communications, data processing and market intelligence. IT plays an integral role in every industry by helping companies improve business processes, achieve cost efficiencies, drive revenue growth and maintain
            a competitive advantage in the marketplace. Without information technology and system support, businesses simply stop! If the internet or phone service goes down in an office, nothing can get done â€” HR, finance, operations, communications,
            sales, and all other departments depend on functional computer and information systems to complete their work. Plus, IT and Information Services (or IS) protect the integrity of data and keep it safe from a world of technological threats
        </p><br>

        <p>1.2 - We can plan and review our use of pre-defined or commonly used IT tools for work activities that are at times non-routine or unfamiliar. As a result of reviewing our work, We will be able to devise solutions using IT tools in order to improve
            work productivity. Any aspect that is unfamiliar will require support and advice from other people. I need to communicate efficiently within a team, with a digital project you can do this on platforms such as Zoom and Discord. Each member
            of a team needs a defined role with set responsibilities to make sure everyone is contributing
        </p><br>

        <p>1.3 - I will start by brain storming writing down ideas. I can use trello to display the units i wish to cover and what methodical order i am going to start planning my work out, i find it useful because it allows me to use a cambam method which
            makes things alot more organized and practical for me. When i was on my website i ended up setting the units out in order i would complete them and added them when was needed what made the process very easy and organised
        </p><br>


        <p>1.4 - Even the most carefully planned project can run into trouble. No matter how well we plan, Our project we can always encounter unexpected problems. For example, me and other team members could get sick or even the weather can make it difficult
            to finish a task given . So does that mean that were helpless against unknown problems? No! we can use risk planning to identify potential problems that could cause trouble for your project, analyze how likely they are to occur, take action
            to prevent the risks you can avoid, and minimize the ones that you can make by not understanding the aim of the project of task properly, overcomplicating tasks
        </p><br>

        <p> 1.5 - For the codenation course we need to install zoom, slack and Visual studio code. the reason for zoom was so we could confrence call all day from home and actuall make it seem like we were in a classroom enviroment. Slack was a peace of software
            that was treated like a social media place for help any questions we have along the course and to share our work and ideas along the way. Visual Studio code was for the javascript part of the course ensuring most of the class use software
            so we could easily identify problems what may occur
        </p><br>

        <p> 1.6 - Trello has been a very big part in this course as it has allowed me too utilise the cam bam method and plan the approach to my website in a very methodical way and as being a very busy person made things so much easier for me. Github is
            another very usful peace of software that can help me with parts of code am stuck on allowing other people to comment add and take aways parts of code so that can be very useful when stuck and need help.

        </p><br>

        <p> 1.7 - This regulation has been implemented in all local privacy laws across the entire EU and EEA region. It will apply to all companies selling to and storing personal information about citizens in Europe, including companies on other continents.
            What GDPR means is that citizens of the EU and EEA now have greater control over their personal data and assurances that their information is being securely protected across Europe.. More information on GDPR can be found on this website -
