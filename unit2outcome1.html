            <p>1.1 - The layout for each page on my site was a basic but stylish design, starting with a navigation bar at the top right of the page, followed by the question to the course work what we had to complete in such short time. there are also clickable
                link's to give the reader more of an insight if they would like more stuff to read.

            <p>1.5 - Copyright refers to the legal protection of original works of authorship. This includes literary, written, dramatic, artistic, musical, and other types of creative expression. It does not include industrial or technological inventions,
                although there are jurisdictions that consider computer software a creative work capable of copyright. Sometimes copyright protection overlaps with other types of intellectual property. For example, an online game may contain storylines
                and music appropriate for copyright registration, but also contains processes that need protection under patent law. As indicated, copyright protection is effective as soon as you post your website. To remind users of this protection,
                many websites add copyright notices to the footer.Since new content on a website technically requires additional registration, many developers place a range of years on their website to cover all past and current content.There is no set
                template for copyright notices. They are actually not required in the first place--just a long-established habit. Developers use them for reassurance and a reminder to the world that the material is copyrighted rather than as a way to
                enhance legal rights. Registration is recommended if you want civil remedies for copyright infringement. Websites are vulnerable because it is easy to copy online content and reuse it. If you do not want your proprietary creations being
                reproduced without your permission, look into registration.

            <p>1.6 - This section describes several general groupings of disabilities, and how they affect access to the Web. There are no universally accepted or absolute categorizations of disability. Disability terminology varies from country to country,
                and between different disability communities in the same country. Abilities can vary from person to person, or over time, for different people with the same kind of disability. People can have combinations of different limitations, such
                as a visual and hearing disability together. This particular combination of disabilities is described below. The term "disability" itself is also used very generally in this document. Many people with conditions described below would not
                consider themselves to have disabilities; they may, however, have limitations related to sensory, physical or cognitive functioning which can affect access to the Web. Limitations can include injury-related and aging-related conditions,
                and can be temporary ,or chronic. An example of an injury-related limitation that is temporary for some people and chronic for others repetitive stress syndrome. There is a trend in some communities away from using medical terminology
                to describe disability, and a trend in many communities away from using negative terminology or epithets frequently used in the past. This Draft Note does not attempt to comprehensively address these issues of terminology. Different disabilities
                sometimes require similar accommodations. For instance, both someone who is blind and someone who cannot use his or her hands require full keyboard support for the commands in browsers and authoring tools, since they both have difficulty
                using a mouse but can use different assistive technologies to activate commands that are supported by a standard keyboard interface. The number and severity of disabilities tend to increase as people with age, and may include changes in
                vision, hearing, memory, or motor function, which can be accommodated on the Web as with any other disabilities. Many of the accessibility solutions described in this Note contribute to "universal design" or "design for all" by benefiting
                non-disabled users. For example, support for speech output not only benefits blind users, but also Web users whose eyes are busy with other tasks; while captions of audio not only benefit deaf users but also increase the efficiency of
                indexing and searching audio content on Web sites

            <p>1.7 - Well if we are talking about this website i used HTML, CSS and JavaScript are very commom when coding for front and back end in website deveolpment There are technologies these that use specialised types of files to make the human side
                of the coding easier. These files are then complied into .html, .css and .js to make them compatible for ease of use and web deveolpment uploading files to a website, the appropriate file types are controlled by the HTML code of the website
                so no malicious files can be uploaded
